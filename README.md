# BlackJackGame
Simple BlackJack game in C++
The objective of the program is for the user to acquire a total of 21 without going over, starting with 2 cards each game.
If the player gets a 21 than itâ€™s an instant win, going over 21 is a bust, and otherwise the player gets to choose whether or not they want another card. 
The card will be picked randomly from a number between 1-10.
